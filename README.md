# AI-Intro-Chess

All the necessary code and files required for the Chess AI and Chess game itself is in the Chess_Game folder.
pip install requirements.txt into a new virtual enviroment.

The Main.py run the Main.py script and a GUI will pop up that will display the chess board. 
It will look like the code has frozen, but it is actually the AI deciding the next move.
The AI is the white chess piece while the black chess piece is the player.
Everytime the AI is making a move, the GUI will look like it is freezing, but it is actually still functioning. 
The player can click on the black piece to show what moves are available to that piece. 
The available moves are highlighted blue will a red outline. 
The player can then click on the blue box to move the piece to that square. 

The test_evaluation.py can be run to see some hardcoded board states. 
For the output to be seen, the GUI that pops up must be exited first.
Afterwards, the output will be displayed.
